# 🐾 Bufeta

Bufeta is a Flutter app built for **testing and learning** purposes — a playground for exploring different approaches to **automatic testing in Flutter**.  

Currently, the app displays random cat images fetched from the public [TheCatAPI](https://api.thecatapi.com/), with a simple button to load new images. Over time, Bufeta will evolve as new testing strategies, UI components, and Flutter features are explored.
