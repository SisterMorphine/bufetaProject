# 🐾 Bufeta

Bufeta is a Flutter app built for **testing and learning** purposes — a playground for exploring different approaches to **automatic testing in Flutter**.  

Currently, the app displays random cat images fetched from the public [TheCatAPI](https://api.thecatapi.com/), with a simple button to load new images. Over time, Bufeta will evolve as new testing strategies, UI components, and Flutter features are explored.

We are using Bloc library for App state management https://bloclibrary.dev/
